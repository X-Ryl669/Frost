    /** Usual scope pointer class with operator overloading.
        Unlike the ScopeGuard, this changes the declaration line of the pointer, but can be passed around.

        We found from our experience that reference counting was not an efficient way to deal with pointers for automatic resource management.
        RefCounting can create loops, requires an additional counter storage (since the ClassPath compiles on 32bits systems, we don't expect
        high bits in the pointer to be available for storing a counter).
        Most of the time, the reference counting never goes above 1, so this is a sign that a more efficient solution could be used.
        We present ScopePtr and OwnPtr here. A ScopePtr stored a pointer and delete it when it's deleted (usually when it goes out of scope).
        OwnPtr is like a ScopePtr except that it tracks if it owns the pointer to the object. It can be sold to become a WeakPtr.
        @sa OwnPtr

        There is nothing special with this, usage is quite
        transparent (use like a pointer) thanks to operator overloading.

    /** This is like a scoped pointer class, except that the ownership
        is specified at construction, and can be changed during lifetime with the sold() method.
        You can only sell a pointer that's owned, obviously.

        Typically, OwnPtr is a reference counted smart pointer for the poor, except that it
        doesn't come with the pain/overload of reference counting. In most use case, references in such smart pointer
        never overcome 2, so it's often easier to just design the code with OwnPtr and transfer ownership explicitely
        when the refCount would reach 2 with a shared pointer (likely at a single place in the code).

        The interface using a reference &, like operator = and constructor won't own the object by default, while the other will.

        Unlike smart pointers (with reference counting), OwnPtr can deal with stack based object correctly
        (smart pointer need pointers allocated on the heap). So it's also a simple way to return either heap allocated or
        member's reference without the user knowning about it.
        For example, this is possible with no copy required:
        @code
            struct A
            {
                Item cache;
                OwnPtr<Item> getItem(int id)
                {
                    if (id == 0) return (Item*)0; // Invalid identifier
                    if (id == cache.id) return cache; // Return a probably stack based object
                    else return new Item(id); // Return a heap allocated object
                }
            };

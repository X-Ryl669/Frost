    /** The asynchronous file stream.

        All IO operations in this stream will likely return Asynchronous error.
        This is the expected behaviour.
        Using asynchronous file stream is a bit more difficult than classic stream,
        as you'll have to handle asynchronous operations.

        Using this class is interesting when you're reading or writing multiple
        different files and you don't want to write them sequentially (adding the latency),
        but as fast as possible (max of biggest latency).

        Typically using this class is done like this:
        @code
            function read(AsyncStream & stream, char * buffer, int length)
            {
                // Start the reading operation
                int ret = stream.read(buffer, length);
                int len = 0;
                // You should wait until the read operation is possible
                while (ret == Asynchronous && stream.isReadPossible(DefaultTimeout))
                {   // Then read
                    ret = stream.read(&buffer[len], length - len);
                    if (ret > 0 && ret < (length - len))
                    {
                        len += ret;
                        ret == Asynchronous;
                    }
                }
            }
        @endcode

        @warning You must not increase the read / write size between call. Doing so could cause unexpected behaviour.

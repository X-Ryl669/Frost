/** Typically, the configuration in ClassPath can be done by different ways.
    Either you modify this file (but you'll need to maintain it when you pull from the official repository),
    Either you build the ClassPath with -DHasClassPathConfig=1 -DWantXXX=1, (or whatever suits your development environment)
    Either you provide a buildConfig file that's included by the Makefile to make these flags:
    Such file is never included in the repository so the format should be like this:
    @verbatim
    WantSSLCode WantDynamicEngine WantPingCode WantAES WantMD5Hashing WantThreadLocalStorage WantBaseEncoding WantFloatParsing WantRegularExpressions WantTimedProfiling WantAtomicClass WantExtendedLock WantSOAP WantCompression WantBSCCompression WantLightImageCode WantAsyncFile WantDatabase
    @endverbatim
    Please notice that the former does not change the link dependencies (like on miniupnpc or openssl even if disabled), while the later
    change them, the Makefile adapts to the flags.
    Under Windows, you need to fix the solution by yourself if you want to strip dependencies */
